**What did I do today?**
I fixed my GitHub error from yesterday.
I found, installed and configurated a tool that was new to me.
I started the SCRUM board.

**What will I do tomorrow?**
I will try to finish the SCRUM board and start the documentation.

**What hinders my progress?**
The GitHub error from yesterday put me back a few hours, but I managed to find a workaround.
The temperature in my room is not very pleasant, so I'll try to work on the balcony from now on.
