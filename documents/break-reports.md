I spent my lunch break in a train on the way to the appointment.  
  
## 01.07.2020  
I have forgotten, that I have breaks today, which means, that I did not do any.  
  
## 02.07.2020  
I did manage to remember to do a break, but it was a short one, since I ate my food at my laptop.  
  
## 03.07.2020  
I did not really make a break, since my girlfriend brought lunch to my workstation.  
  
## 06.07.2020  
I did make a break today.  
  
## 07.07.2020  
I only made a small break today, since my medication makes me lose my appetite.  
I played some bass to get my mind off of work.  
  
## 08.07.2020  
I still don't feel hungry at all, which is why I never know what to do in my breaks.  
I just continued to play bass and learnt a new song.  
That really helped to not sink into the "programmer-hole" and not being able to stop working.  
  
## 09.07.2020  
I created reminders on my phone for my breaks, which really helps me remember them.  
I have not eaten actual food since I've taken my medication. 
Never have I realised how long a 30 minute break can feel like.
