## 08.07.2020  
I still don't feel hungry at all, which is why I never know what to do in my breaks.  
I just continued to play bass and learnt a new song.  
That really helped to not sink into the "programmer-hole" and not being able to stop working.  
  
## 09.07.2020  
I created reminders on my phone for my breaks, which really helps me remember them.  
I have not eaten actual food since I've taken my medication. 
Never have I realised how long a 30 minute break can feel like.
