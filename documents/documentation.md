## Stock analysis  
**How did I get the idea?**    
I was a bit unsure to what the project needs to make it a useful utility app.  
Then I found a dataset of all parking lots for the disabled in the city of Zurich.  
I thought this might be useful for disabled people, to find a parking spot.    
  
**Is the app going to be of any use?**  
If you're new to Zurich or just have not been to town very often, you might not know where to park your car, especially when you're disabled and need a parking spot.  
The app might also contain the different pricing zones for Zurich, if I find the time for it.  
  
**What are similar apps and how do they compare?**  
I do not know of a parking app for Zurich.  
There might be one, which I don't know about, but there cerainly is not a lot of them.  
My app also does not collect any data and will be open-source, so nobody needs to fear for their privacy.  
  
**What kind of features will the app have?**  
I'm still not too sure on what to put into the app, but it will definitely be able to show parking spaces for disabled people, bikes and standard cars.  
It will also show public parkhouses and may show the pricing zones.  
Depending on the time I have left on this app, I may add a route feature, so someone can find the parking lots easier.  
An info screen for parkhouses and bike parking spaces might also be a nice idea.  
  
**Is the app free and will the support for it be continued?**  
This really depends on, if I add it to the playstore and people actually download it.  
It will always be a free app, but I may have to limit the amount of API requests per user.  
Maybe there will be a premium subscription with a lot more requests available.  
It also depends on, if the app will be finished, until I start working at Rafisa.  
The future of this project is still a bit unclear due to time being a sparse ressource.  
  
**When will the app be finished?**  
Whenever I start work at Rafisa.  
This will probably be either in the beginning or the middle of August this year.  
I'll see, if I find the time to continue it afterwards.  
Really depends on my motivation and the amount of free time I'll have.  
  
**Where is the app now?**  
The app in it's current state is not usable for a user.  
It's still a dev build, and all the features are still controlled from within the code.  
This might change soon though.  
  
  
## Target group  
The target group of this app is people, who are often in unfamiliar cities.  
Using this app, they could easily find the way to some kind of public transport.

## Setup and Environment  
I work from home using my personal laptop, that I bought for school.  
Working on the balcony makes it easy for me have a relaxed environment, while not having a bed I could fall asleep on.  
As an IDE I use Visual Studio Code, using Git as a source control.  
  
  
## Scope and daily effort  
I work 8 hours a day from monday to friday for about a month.  
Breaks are 15 minutes before and after lunch, while lunch break is an hour.
