**What did I do today?**  
I fixed my GitHub error from yesterday.  
I found, installed and configurated a tool that was new to me.  
I started the SCRUM board.  
  
**What will I do tomorrow?**  
I will try to finish the SCRUM board and start the documentation.  
  
**What hinders my progress?**  
The GitHub error from yesterday put me back a few hours, but I managed to find a workaround.  
The temperature in my room is not very pleasant, so I'll try to work on the balcony from now on.

**What did I do today?**  
I finished the SCRUM board and the stock analysis.  
I also started to read into the OpenHERE Maps API and got the API keys.  
  
**What will I do tomorrow?**  
I will finish my application mail and send it to Pete.  
I will try to work more on the documentation.  
I will try to implement the map component.

**What hinders my progress?**
The OpenHERE Maps API was written for javascript and not for typescript.
The documentation for the API is on an older version, which does make a huge difference.
It's hard to concentrate with this weather going on.
It's also rather hard to stay focused, whenever there is an error that doesn't want to go away for hours.
