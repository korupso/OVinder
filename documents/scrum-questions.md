**What did I do today?**  
I fixed my GitHub error from yesterday.  
I found, installed and configurated a tool that was new to me.  
I started the SCRUM board.  
  
**What will I do tomorrow?**  
I will try to finish the SCRUM board and start the documentation.  
  
**What hinders my progress?**  
The GitHub error from yesterday put me back a few hours, but I managed to find a workaround.  
The temperature in my room is not very pleasant, so I'll try to work on the balcony from now on.

**What did I do today?**  
I finished the SCRUM board and the stock analysis.  
I also started to read into the OpenHERE Maps API and got the API keys.  
  
**What will I do tomorrow?**  
I will finish my application mail and send it to Pete.  
I will try to work more on the documentation.  
I will try to implement the map component.
  
**What hinders my progress?**  
The OpenHERE Maps API was written for javascript and not for typescript.  
The documentation for the API is on an older version, which does make a huge difference.  
It's hard to concentrate with this weather going on.  
It's also rather hard to stay focused, whenever there is an error that doesn't want to go away for hours.

**What did I do today?**  
I have finished writing my application mail for Rafisa AG.  
> It went rather well and I did not have to spend too much time on it.  
I have read the documentation for OpenHERE Maps API and I fiddled around with it in an example project.  
> This did not go so well, because javascript did not recognize the MIME type the API was sending, since it's a padded JSON and not a normal one.  
> I also got a version mismatch error, since the tutorial I followed was obsolete.  
> I fixed the error after a bit of trial and error, until I got another error.  
  
**What will I do tomorrow?**  
I will work on the documentation the whole morning and I'll try to check off some tasks on the scrum board relating to the documentation.  
On the afternoon I'll try to find a fix or a workaround for the current error I'm having.  
  
**What hinders my progress?**  
I have got another error in my program.  
This time the error is an InvalidArgumentError caused by the HERE Platform Data Extension API in the service namespace.  
Apparently I have not given the correct arguments in the correct order or the correct count.  
I will continue to read the documentation on Fleet Telematics Advanced Data Sets that the API is using.
