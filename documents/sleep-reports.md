> I feel like I'm starting to get there.  
> I'm home alone today, which means, that nobody is able to wake me up.  
> Nevertheless I did not oversleep and also did not forget to take my medication.  
> Can't really remember anything of what happened before 09:00 though.  
> Luckily I made a post in the progress logs.

> **Description**  
> I slept pretty late, since I had to help my girlfriend with a school project.  
> Her teampartner did not do his work and I wouldn't have been able to, to just watch her get a bad grade without it being her fault.  
> I woke up early enough to gain some conciousness before starting work, which is a nice thing to have.  
> I did take three Elvanse today instead of one, which is probably one of the reasons it worked out so well.

> I was able to wake up on time, which was 30 minutes earlier than usual as well.  
> But I did not have a lot of time in the morning, I basically had to jump out of bed, directly to the front door.  
> I did forget to take my melatonin though, which probably was the issue.
