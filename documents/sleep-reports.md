> I feel like I'm starting to get there.  
> I'm home alone today, which means, that nobody is able to wake me up.  
> Nevertheless I did not oversleep and also did not forget to take my medication.  
> Can't really remember anything of what happened before 09:00 though.

> I slept pretty late, since I had to help my girlfriend with a school project.  
> Her teampartner did not do his work and I wouldn't have been able to, to just watch her get a bad grade without it being her fault.  
> I woke up early enough to gain some conciousness before starting work, which is a nice thing to have.  
> I did take three Elvanse today instead of one, which is probably one of the reasons it worked out so well.
