### 3/5  
**Description**  
I did not sleep very well, which may have to do with the temperature in my room.  
It got better once I closed my shutters.

**Description**  
I think I got used to my alarm sound, since I did not hear it today.  
I'll have to change it for tomorrow to see how it affects my morning.

I was barely able to sleep yesterday night.  
I did not feel very well and involuntairily stood up almost all night.  
I managed to wake up though, which is good.

I managed to wake up on time, but I was rather tired in the morning.  
The different alarm helps a lot.
