## Stock analysis  
  
**How did I get the idea?**    
I thought about making an app, which tells you the closest stops and connections from that stop, a while ago, but never had the time to work on it.  
Since I needed a project, I wanted to realize my past idea.  
  
**Is the app going to be of any use?**  
Sometimes you just need to know where the next bus stop is.  
And yes, that's already somewhat accomplishable with other apps that already exist, but no other app I know of has this specific feature.  
  
**What are similar apps and how do they compare?**  
The big one is Google Maps, but as I mentioned above, it is missing this feature.  
Google Maps may probably be faster at finding stations, but my app will not collect any unnecessary data (if any).
